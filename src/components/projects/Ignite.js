      <section className="section-problem">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Many people, especially newcomers to fitness, face challenges such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lack of Motivation:</strong> Difficulty in starting and sticking to workout routines.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Knowledge:</strong> Inexperience in planning effective workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Struggling to maintain a regular exercise schedule.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="section-solution">

          <li><strong>Workout Recommendations:</strong> Personalized exercise suggestions to help users find enjoyable and effective workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Activity Logging:</strong> A user-friendly interface for logging workouts, tracking progress, and reflecting on achievements.</li>
          <li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Displaying individual and team progress to encourage healthy competition and accountability.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="section-development">
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <h3>Research and Ideation</h3>
        <h4>Literature Review</h4>
        <p>To inform the design of Ignite, the team conducted a thorough literature review, focusing on studies related to motivation and exercise habits. Two key studies that influenced the design were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>"Get thee to the gym! A field experiment on improving exercise habits" by Condliffe et al.:</strong> This study found that combining incentives with information feedback and team membership significantly enhances exercise efficacy. It provided a basis for incorporating social feedback and incentives in Ignite.</li>
          <li><strong>"The Effect of Social Support on Athlete Burnout in Weightlifters" by Shang and Yang:</strong> This research highlighted that social support increases mental toughness and motivation, thereby preventing burnout. It underscored the importance of incorporating social accountability within Ignite.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Comparator Analysis</h4>
        <p>The team conducted an analysis of existing fitness tools, categorizing them based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Source of Motivation:</strong> Extrinsic (e.g., financial rewards, social affirmation) vs. Intrinsic (e.g., personal development, enjoyment).</li>
          <li><strong>Specificity of Activity:</strong> Tools focused on specific fitness goals versus those promoting general well-being.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This analysis revealed gaps in the market, particularly the need for a balanced approach that incorporates both extrinsic and intrinsic motivators while accommodating various types of physical activities. Our goal with Ignite is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Balance Motivations:</strong> Use competition and social support for extrinsic motivation, and logging/reflection and progress visualization for intrinsic motivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Optimal Scope:</strong> Accommodate a variety of exercises to support exploration while focusing on beginner to intermediate fitness levels. This ensures that basic functionalities are simple and accessible, with advanced options available for those seeking more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <p><strong>Baseline Study:</strong> To gain deeper insights into users' exercise habits, motivations, and obstacles, the team conducted a baseline study involving:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pre-Screener Surveys:</strong> These surveys assessed participants' current exercise habits, satisfaction levels, and motivations. They helped in selecting a representative sample for the study.</li>
          <li><strong>Interviews and Diary Study:</strong> Participants were interviewed to understand their exercise routines, goals, and challenges. They then logged their daily exercise activities and reflections over five days using a structured form. This provided detailed insights into their behaviors and experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our study included n=10 participants from which we received 43 total responses over five days, for a success rate of 43/50, or 86%. Going with n=10 participants initially gave us a valuable buffer that allowed some people to miss a day of recording and us to still receive useful data.</p>

      <section className="section-theory">
        <h3>Grounded Theory</h3>
        <p>A grounded theory analysis was conducted after the studyâ€™s completion led to the following theories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Philosophical Foundation:</strong> The core of sustained workout routines lies in a personal philosophy and intrinsic motivation. When individuals exercise for meaningful, internally rewarding reasons rather than external validation, they are more likely to maintain consistency. This deep-seated motivation is crucial for long-term adherence.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Accountability and Group Dynamics:</strong> Social support through group exercises or accountability partners significantly enhances workout consistency. The social element provides a framework for regularity and shared objectives, reducing the likelihood of skipping workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Setting and Progress Measurement:</strong> Setting specific, measurable, and realistic goals helps maintain focus and direction in workout routines. Tracking progress provides a tangible sense of achievement and motivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Loss Aversion:</strong> Establishing a consistent workout routine becomes a driving force, where the discomfort of breaking it outweighs the effort required to follow it. This ensures discipline even on days of low motivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Getting Started:</strong> Initial barriers to exercise, both mental and physical, must be overcome to establish a sustainable routine. Comfort and knowledge about exercise are crucial, and mental resilience often plays a more critical role than physical capability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, by understanding these theories, individuals can tailor their approach to fitness in a way that aligns with their motivations, lifestyle, and psychological needs, increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence to workout routines. Exercise means something different to everyone, and making it more satisfying will improve routines and, by extension, lives.</p>
        <p>Everyone acknowledges the benefits of working out and increasing frequency, however, college students are very good at making excuses for missing a workout. To increase frequency, students need to schedule their workouts, compete with friends, visualize metrics, and maintain a frequency that establishes a routine such that missing becomes more tangible.</p>

      <section className="section-systems">
        <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
        <img src={ignite_circle} alt="Connection Circle" className="system-image" />
        <p>There are 2 loops that we can see in the connection circle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exercise->progress->feel good->motivation->exercise more</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Energy->exercise motivation->exercise->more energy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first loop is quite intuitive. Progress itself is a positive feedback loop that encourages more motivation for progress. The second loop is less obvious â€“ although exercise may lead to fatigue, it may also lead to more energy as many interview participants brought up.</p>
      </section>
